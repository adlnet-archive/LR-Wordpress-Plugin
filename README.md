   * [How to activate and configure widgets](http://en.support.wordpress.com/widgets/)
0. Configure the `LR Interface Results` widget.
  * `Number of Results Per Page` is mandatory and is set to `50` by defualt.
  * `Results page text` is used to explicitly specify the format in which the header on the Results page is displayed. `$query` is replaced with the search term. Example: if you set the page text as `Showing results for $query` and the user searches for `math`, then the header on the Results page will be `Showing results for math`

###Global Plugin Settings

  * `Results` should be set to the name of the newly created Results page.
